# handwritten_digit_recognition
This project was developed as part of my undergraduate coursework in December 2019. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras and TensorFlow to recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9) from grayscale images, trained with extensive data augmentation for improved robustness.
